---As part of my digital marketing internship, I was assigned to develop a brand reputation management strategy. This task involved analyzing the brandâ€™s online presence, monitoring customer feedback, and identifying areas for improvement. I researched methods to handle negative reviews effectively while promoting positive sentiment through engaging content and customer interactions. Additionally, I explored reputation management tools to track mentions and sentiment analysis across various platforms. I also created a structured plan outlining response strategies for customer concerns, crisis management tactics, and proactive measures to build trust and credibility. The final deliverable was a documented strategy along with tools for implementation, ensuring the brand maintains a positive online reputation.
